        Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each class
        to derive Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) filters.

        In the context of EEG data analysis, CSP filters are used
        to maximize the variance between two or more classes
        of brain states or activities, such as
        'rest', 'left_hand_open', and 'right_hand_open'.
        Each class is represented by its covariance matrix,
        which captures the statistical relationship between
        EEG channels.

        Eigenvalues quantify the variance along the directions
        represented by eigenvectors. In a typical scenario with
        64 EEG channels and 4 labels
        (e.g., left hand open, right hand open), there are
        6 unique combinations of covariance matrices (4 choose 2 = 6).
        For each combination, this function computes 6 eigenvalues
        and their corresponding eigenvectors.

        The use of generalized eigenvalue calculation is unnecessary
        here, as we are dealing with covariance matrices representing
        distinct EEG conditions without a need for a second matrix
        (B) in the form Ax = Î»Bx. Instead, each covariance matrix is
        regularized with a small epsilon value to ensure numerical
        stability and avoid singularities.
